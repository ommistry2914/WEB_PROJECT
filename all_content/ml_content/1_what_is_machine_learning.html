        alt="Machine Learning Tutorial" class="imageright" />
    <p>The Machine Learning Tutorial covers both the fundamentals and more complex ideas of machine learning. Students
        and professionals in the workforce can benefit from our machine learning tutorial.</p>
    <p>A rapidly developing field of technology, machine learning allows computers to automatically learn from previous
        data. For building mathematical models and making predictions based on historical data or information, machine
        learning employs a variety of algorithms. It is currently being used for a variety of tasks, including speech
        recognition, email filtering, auto-tagging on Facebook, a recommender system, and image recognition.</p>
    <p>You will learn about the many different methods of machine learning, including reinforcement learning, supervised
        learning, and unsupervised learning, in this machine learning tutorial. Regression and classification models,
        clustering techniques, hidden Markov models, and various sequential models will all be covered.</p>
    <h2 class="h2">What is Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>In the real world, we are surrounded by humans who can learn everything from their experiences with their
        learning capability, and we have computers or machines which work on our instructions. But can a machine also
        learn from experiences or past data like a human does? So here comes the role of <strong>Machine
            Learning</strong>.</p>
    <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/machine-learning/images/introduction-to-machine-learning.png"
        alt="Introduction to Machine Learning" />
    <p><strong>Introduction to Machine Learning</strong></p>
    <p>A subset of artificial intelligence known as machine learning focuses primarily on the creation of algorithms
        that enable a computer to independently learn from data and previous experiences. Arthur Samuel first used the
        term "machine learning" in 1959. It could be summarized as follows:</p>
    <p>Without being explicitly programmed, machine learning enables a machine to automatically learn from data, improve
        performance from experiences, and predict things.</p>
    <p>Machine learning algorithms create a mathematical model that, without being explicitly programmed, aids in making
        predictions or decisions with the assistance of sample historical data, or training data. For the purpose of
        developing predictive models, machine learning brings together statistics and computer science. Algorithms that
        learn from historical data are either constructed or utilized in machine learning. The performance will rise in
        proportion to the quantity of information we provide.</p>
    <p><strong>A machine can learn if it can gain more data to improve its performance.</strong></p>
    <h2 class="h2">How does Machine Learning work</h2>
    <p>A machine learning system builds prediction models, learns from previous data, and predicts the output of new
        data whenever it receives it. The amount of data helps to build a better model that accurately predicts the
        output, which in turn affects the accuracy of the predicted output.</p>
    <p>Let's say we have a complex problem in which we need to make predictions. Instead of writing code, we just need
        to feed the data to generic algorithms, which build the logic based on the data and predict the output. Our
        perspective on the issue has changed as a result of machine learning. The Machine Learning algorithm's operation
        is depicted in the following block diagram:</p>
    <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/machine-learning/images/introduction-to-machine-learning2.png"
        alt="Introduction to Machine Learning" />
    <h2 class="h2">Features of Machine Learning:</h2>
    <ul class="points">
        <li>Machine learning uses data to detect various patterns in a given dataset.</li>
        <li>It can learn from past data and improve automatically.</li>
        <li>It is a data-driven technology.</li>
        <li>Machine learning is much similar to data mining as it also deals with the huge amount of the data.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="h2">Need for Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>The demand for machine learning is steadily rising. Because it is able to perform tasks that are too complex for
        a person to directly implement, machine learning is required. Humans are constrained by our inability to
        manually access vast amounts of data; as a result, we require computer systems, which is where machine learning
        comes in to simplify our lives.</p>
    <p>By providing them with a large amount of data and allowing them to automatically explore the data, build models,
        and predict the required output, we can train machine learning algorithms. The cost function can be used to
        determine the amount of data and the machine learning algorithm's performance. We can save both time and money
        by using machine learning.</p>
    <p>The significance of AI can be handily perceived by its utilization's cases, Presently, AI is utilized in
        self-driving vehicles, digital misrepresentation identification, face acknowledgment, and companion idea by
        Facebook, and so on. Different top organizations, for example, Netflix and Amazon have constructed AI models
        that are utilizing an immense measure of information to examine the client interest and suggest item likewise.

    <p>Following are some key points which show the importance of Machine Learning:</p>
    <ul class="points">
        <li>Rapid increment in the production of data</li>
        <li>Solving complex problems, which are difficult for a human</li>
        <li>Decision making in various sector including finance</li>
        <li>Finding hidden patterns and extracting useful information from data.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="h2">Classification of Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>At a broad level, machine learning can be classified into three types:</p>
    <ol class="points">
        <li><strong>Supervised learning</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Unsupervised learning</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/machine-learning/images/classification-of-machine-learning.png"
        alt="Introduction to Machine Learning" />
    <h3 class="h3">1) Supervised Learning</h3>
    <p>In supervised learning, sample labeled data are provided to the machine learning system for training, and the
        system then predicts the output based on the training data.</p>
    <p>The system uses labeled data to build a model that understands the datasets and learns about each one. After the
        training and processing are done, we test the model with sample data to see if it can accurately predict the
        output.</p>
    <p>The mapping of the input data to the output data is the objective of supervised learning. The managed learning
        depends on oversight, and it is equivalent to when an understudy learns things in the management of the
        educator. Spam filtering is an example of supervised learning.</p>
    <p>Supervised learning can be grouped further in two categories of algorithms:</p>
    <ul class="points">
        <li><strong>Classification</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Regression</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="h3">2) Unsupervised Learning</h3>
    <p>Unsupervised learning is a learning method in which a machine learns without any supervision.</p>
    <p>The training is provided to the machine with the set of data that has not been labeled, classified, or
        categorized, and the algorithm needs to act on that data without any supervision. The goal of unsupervised
        learning is to restructure the input data into new features or a group of objects with similar patterns.</p>
    <p>In unsupervised learning, we don't have a predetermined result. The machine tries to find useful insights from
        the huge amount of data. It can be further classifieds into two categories of algorithms:</p>
    <ul class="points">
        <li><strong>Clustering</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Association</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="h3">3) Reinforcement Learning</h3>
    <p>Reinforcement learning is a feedback-based learning method, in which a learning agent gets a reward for each
        right action and gets a penalty for each wrong action. The agent learns automatically with these feedbacks and
        improves its performance. In reinforcement learning, the agent interacts with the environment and explores it.
        The goal of an agent is to get the most reward points, and hence, it improves its performance.</p>
    <p>The robotic dog, which automatically learns the movement of his arms, is an example of Reinforcement learning.

    <h2 class="h2">History of Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>Before some years (about 40-50 years), machine learning was science fiction, but today it is the part of our
        daily life. Machine learning is making our day to day life easy from <strong>self-driving cars</strong> to
        <strong>Amazon virtual assistant "Alexa"</strong>. However, the idea behind machine learning is so old and has a
        long history. Below some milestones are given which have occurred in the history of machine learning:
